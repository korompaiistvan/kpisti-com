		For this length of time, your main job is to prevent house training accidents and supervise the
		doggo, making sure he does not get into unwanted shenanigans. You also have the option to for
		some bonding time with him, by playing or petting him.
	</p>

	<p>Below is a bunch of info, the most important ones have been marked. The rest is optional.</p>

	<h2>Managing potty</h2>

	<p>
		Gesztenye can hold his bladder for up to 8 hours if he's resting, but can lose control of it
		when excited. This requires a bit of time management around his potty breaks. Things that limit
		his bladder control, shortening the time between required potty breaks are: - drinking - eating
		- play - intense enjoyment, after e.g. a thorough petting - training
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, there isn't an easy tell for when he has to go - at least not one we noticed. The
		following things might each point to him wanting to go outside for a pee. They are listed in
		increasing order of obviousness - sniffing the floor a lot - he stands in the hallway, between
		the rooms and looks at the entrance - suddenly gets up from a lying position and does any of the
		above
	</p>

	<p>
		He regularly does the first two, so if you've recently been on a potty break (e.g. less than 20
		mins ago), you can fairly safely ignore it).
	</p>

	<h2>Potty accidents</h2>

	<p>
		In case he does have an accident in the flat, do not worry, it happens to us too,. If you catch
		him doing it, just interrupt with a calm, confident "No". If you realise only afterwards that it
		happened, just mark its unwantedness with a simple, disappointed "Oops"/"Ah-ah"/"Ó jaj" and take
		the following steps. 1. Get a training pad from the storage closet, open it up and lay it on the
		pee, absorbent side down. This will soak up the pee, giving you time to take the dog outside as
		quickly as possible 2. Put on your shoes and coat first, and take the doggie go-bag 3. Put the
		leash on the dogs collar 4. Don't forget your keys 5. Go for a potty break 6. When he pees
		outside during the potty break,, reward him with a lot of praise and treats 7. Once upstairs,
		prep to clean up the rest of the pee. 8. There is a mason jar in the bathroom, with a greenish
		clear liquid. That is a pee cleaning solution. Take two microfiber cloths from the bath, dip one
		in the cleaning liquid, leave the other one dry. 9. Go to the pee spot, with the two cloths. 10.
		Fold up the training pad with absorbent side on the inside and place it to the side. The plastic
		lining should contain all the pee. If not, just take it to the trash now, before proceeding. 11.
		Take the two cloths, clean up the spot with the wet one, before wiping dry with the other one.
		12. Put the dirty training pad in the trash 13. Rinse and wring the two cleaning cloths, placing
		them on the side of the bath to dry. 14. Final step: be proud of the quick solution and relax
		for a while. Now at least he won't have to pee for a while.
	</p>
	<h2>Conducting a potty break</h2>

	<p>
		Potty breaks are very short and do not require you to actually walk the dog. When you take him
		downstairs, there is a small rectangle of wider sidewalk to the right after exiting. This is his
		potty area, so stand in that area until he wees. When he does, mark the behaviour with a "Yes",
		and once finished, give him a small treat.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once he's done, you can take him upstairs. Since you're watching him only for 4 hours, he should
		not need to poo during this time. If you think he does, just take him for a slightly longer walk
		until the Bandgasse - Westbahnstraße corner and back. That is his poo route, if he does not poo,
		he does not need to.
	</p>

	<h2>Water</h2>

	<p>
		To manage his need for potty, it's advisable to not let him drink too much at once, as he can
		overdrink because of excitement and then he has to pee a lot. Make sure to have about half a cup
		to a cup water in his bowl, but not more. If he drinks it, only refill it after the next potty
		break.
	</p>

	<h2>Supervision</h2>

	<p>
		The other part of the task you so graciously accepted revolves around managing his safety and
		manners. Managing safety revolves around making sure he does chew on wires or plants. His
		manners on the other hand are a longer list of things he is not allowed to do.
	</p>

	<p>
		Most important parts of home manners: - not allowed on any furniture - may not sleep outside his
		crate - yes, in cas-e he does fall asleep somewhere you have to wake him up and put him in his
		crate, as soon as possible - no barking - no jumping up on people - no biting hands, furniture,
		clothing, hair
	</p>
	<h2>Providing motivation for behaviours</h2>

	<p>
		The go-bag has a good amount of treats in it. For training reasons, we would like to kindly ask
		you to not feed him from those, unless the situation heavily calls for it. Such cases are when
		you went to the café and need to manage his attention, or you need to place him in his crate and
		he is not willing.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the other hand, the above guide has a bunch of things he is not allowed to do. You can divert
		them from these with corrections (verbal and physical). Verbal corrections are a simple,
		confident "no", while physical correction here simply refers to removal by force, and NOT
		physical punishment of any sort.
	</p>

	<p>
		These corrections are especially important during play. If you're playing with him and he does
		any of the above prohibited things, please correct him verbally and interrupt the play, by
		crossing your arms and turning away from him. You can resume play after he settles a bit. If he
		does the behaviour after continuation, interrupt the play again.
	</p>

	<h2>Crating and sleep</h2>

	<p>
		Since he's a puppy, he sleeps 15-20 hours a day. This basically means that for every hour he's
		awake and active, he can spend two sleeping. Unfortunately, because he's a puppy, he does not
		settle into sleep on his own, if there are other, more exciting things to do. So, you have two
		choices for his naps: either you comfortably settle onto the sofa, and ignore him, waiting for
		him to go into his crate on his own, or you send him in. Once he's inside you're free to praise
		him for it and close the door.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sending him in works by grabbing two treats from the go-bag, standing next to the crate,
		pointing to it and giving out the "Place" command. If it works, he will enter the crate and sit,
		and you should reward him with one of the treats. Then, as you're still crouching, close the
		crate door, and once closed, praise and reward again.
	</p>

	<p>
		He will look at with you sad puppy eyes when you do this, but be strong and ignore him. I
		promise you he does not hate you for it, he needs his sleep.
	</p>

	<p>
		If he ever gets restless in the crate, and whines or barks, interrupt him with a "No"
		immediately, even if you're in a completely different part of the flat. For example, Pisti often
		says "no", as he's on the toilet, while Gesztenye is in the crate and the dog starts whining.
	</p>

	<p>
		In case he enters the crate on its own, it means he's calm and would like some rest. Do not
		bother him in the crate, that's his space for me time. If you want, you can close the door on
		him, even if he's entered on his own.
	</p>

	<h2>The go-bag</h2>

	<p>
		The colorful fanny pack, holds a couple essential things in case you need to take him for a
		walk. The only things you should need from there are: - poo bags - treats - human hygiene
		products (tissues, wet wipes, disinfectant gel)
	</p>
	<p>
		There are a few other items too, but you shouldn't use those for this short a sitting: - high
		value treats - ball - long line
	</p>
	<h2>Commands</h2>

	<p>
		The only commands you should need for this short time are: - "Sit" - put yo' butt on the ground
		- "Place" and point to crate - go to the crate. currently, usually only works with treats -
		"Stay" - best to give when he's seated, he will try to maintain the sit. Not awfully stable at
		the moment, distraction can easily make it fall apart. - "Break" - you can stop staying, go do
		whatever you want now
	</p>
	<h2>Play</h2>

	<p>
		In case you want to play with him, the best game for tiring him out is tug-of-war. He has a
		rope, usually collected into his crate, so grab it from there. If he's not immediately
		interested, you can call him in a playful voice and wiggle the rope on the ground like a dying
		fish. This usually gets him interested enough to go for it, after which you can start playing
		tug with him.
	</p>

	<p>
		At some point, you'll start noticing him losing interest, so you can try and upping the ante, or
		if that's not working or you've had enough, you can interrupt the play by asking him for a "Sit"
		and taking away the toy into your hands. Once he's seated and has his gaze on you, you can put
		the toy in the front of him, say "Brake" and then start doing your own thing. Once you decided
		to interrupt the play, do not let him invite you back in, he will start playing on his own.
	</p>

	<h2>Recommended schedule for these couple of hours</h2>

	<p>
		He will be fed when we hand him over to you, so you do not need to worry about feeding him. He
		will also most likely have just taken a walk. We will have about 10-15 minutes of overlap before
		we leave him with you. During this time, we'll calmly sit with you on the sofa, have a coffee
		and a chat, until he calms down a bit. After this, we will calmly put on our stuff and leave the
		dog with you.
	</p>

	<p>
		He will be a bit excited after this, so it's best if you call him to yourself, and if he's
		relatively calm, have a small bonding pet session. If he whines or barks, do not pet him, just
		interrupt it with a calm, confident "No". Otherwise, if you think he needs to expell some
		energy, you can try to play with him a little. In any case, 20-30 minutes after we leave, you
		should take him for a potty break.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once done with the potty, if you want to bond, you can play, wrestle or pet him for 5-10
		minutes. After this, you should probably crate him and allow him to sleep for at least1.5-2
		hours. Remember by this point he's been awake for about an hour, so the downtime is welcome.
		During this time, feel free to move around the flat, watch some TV, read or use the office. In
		general, make yourself at home.
	</p>

	<p>
		After this nap, pull him out of the crate, go for a potty break again. Once upstairs, let him
		play on his own outside the crate for 30 minutes, and he will usually enter the crate on his own
		and settle. By this point there should not be a lot of time left until we get back home, so you
		should do some mixture of the following activites: - potty breaks as needed - give him a Kong
		(see below) - playing together - free roam time for hime - pets, there are never enough pets
	</p>
	<h2>Kongs</h2>
	<p>
		if he isn't tired at the moment, but you want some time for yourself, without needing to focus
		on him, there is a frozen Kong toy in the bottom drawer of the freezer. Lure him into the crate
		with it and close the door on him. He will be focused on getting the treats out of that thing,
		which will provide him some stimulation, allowing him to settle afterwards. This gives you about
		an hour to do anything, even if he does not fall asleep. If he does fall asleep afterwards, he
		will be out for a while.
